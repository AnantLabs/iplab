IPLab 2.6.1 release notes
------------------------------
01.10.2009.

- Since most AForge.NET framework's image processing routines work with grayscale
  images and 24 bpp color images (not all routines support 32 bpp images) the IPLab
  converts image to 24 bpp color image on opening if it is not grayscale image.

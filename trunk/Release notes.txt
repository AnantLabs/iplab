IPLab 2.7.0 release notes
------------------------------
06.10.2010.


Version updates and fixes:

- Updated AForge.NET framework's assemblies to the latest 2.1.4 version;

- Added format check on image reloading (not only on initial loading);

- Image reloading is now done without file locking similar to initial loading;

- Added support for some command line arguments:
  * iplab.exe /paste - starts application and opens image from clipboard;
  * iplab.exe /open <file_name> (or just iplab.exe <file_name>) - starts application
    and opens the specified file.

- Added Stereo Anaglyph filter to collection of available filters, which accepts 2 images;

- Allowing to apply blob extraction and filtering to color images as well, since the
  AForge.NET framework allows this;
  
- Adding quadrilateral finder and quadrilateral transformation options (for now it
  transforms only the automatically found quadrilateral);

- Added PNG format to the list of formats in "Save As" dialog;

- Added Document Skew Checker demonstration into the application;

- Moving different effects like Perlin Noise, Oil Painting, etc. into separate menu item group;

- Adding crazy "rombozoid" effect;

- Added Water Wave effect.




IPLab 2.6.1 release notes
------------------------------
01.10.2009.

- Since most AForge.NET framework's image processing routines work with grayscale
  images and 24 bpp color images (not all routines support 32 bpp images) the IPLab
  converts image to 24 bpp color image on opening if it is not grayscale image.

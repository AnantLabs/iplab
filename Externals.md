The IPLab application uses numerous of open source components, which are listed below:
  * [DockManager Control](http://sourceforge.net/projects/dockpanelsuite/) by Weifen Luo (IPLab still uses an old version which was published on CodeProject);
  * [SourceGrid - Open Source C# Grid Control](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/grid/csharpgridcontrol.aspx) by Davide Icardi;
  * [A Simple C# Toolbar Docking Framework](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/menus/ToolBarDock.aspx) by Rog√©rio Paulo.

Thank to all these projects and people, who support them.
